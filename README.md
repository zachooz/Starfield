Starfield with an Oddball
=========================
Program requirements:
Your program must use two classes to model the particles. A "Normal" particle class and an "Oddball" partcle class
All the particles must be stored in a single array using an interface.
Your program must use at least one constant (for number of particles).
Steps to completing this assignment
Fork and clone down the Starfield repository,
First, finish the Particle class. It will need the following members:
5 data members: X and Y positions, Color, Angle and Speed. (Hint use doubles for X, Y, Speed and Angle)
Particle(), the class constructor
void move(), Takes the cos of the angle times the speed and adds it to the X coordinate. Does the same to Y with the sin of the angle.
void show(), sets the current color to the color of the particle and draws a dot using ellipse()
Now finish the program's setup and draw
Add one Particle variable, and see you can see it move
Now modify the program so you have an array of Particles.
 
Finish the Particle interface. It will list two methods:
public void show();
public void move();
Have your NormalParticle implement the Particle interface.
Add public in front of the move() & draw() methods in your Particle class.
Have your OddballParticle implement the Particle interface.
Finish OddballParticle class. It will be very similiar, but OddballParticles should have different move and draw methods.
Change your array of NormalParticles to an array of Particles.
Change the first element in the array to a OddballParticle instead of a NormalParticle

Extensions
Have a fun and be creative. If you have extra time you may want to modify your program and add extra features. Experiment with different arrangements of particles. Look at student work from previous years for other variations.
